# SQL-for-Data-Analysis

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench 8.0
- MySQL Server
- SQL (MySQL)
- CSV Dataset (uploaded and imported into database)
- GitHub for version control and submission

## ðŸ§  Objectives

The goal of this project was to apply various SQL data analysis techniques including:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- JOINS (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`)
- Views for analytical summaries
- Query optimization with `INDEX`

## âœ… Whatâ€™s Included

The SQL script (`shipping_analysis.sql`) includes:

1. Database and table creation
2. CSV data import
3. Customer dimension table creation
4. Exploratory queries using filters and sorting
5. Aggregations (e.g., total orders by shipping mode)
6. JOINS with a customer table for enriched analysis
7. Subqueries (e.g., ratings above average)
8. A `VIEW` for reusable summary insights
9. Creation of an `INDEX` to optimize performance
10. `SHOW INDEXES` to verify index creation
